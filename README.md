## Inspiration
I created this project for the software construction course (CPSC 210) that I took in 2020 Winter - Term 1. The project
consisted of four phases which had to be completed throughout the term. Each phase was structured around a *user story*,
which was essentially a feature that a user would want in the program. For instance, phase two of the project involved
adding data persistence to the application, so some of the user stories I thought of were: 

1. As a user, I want to have the option to save my game before quitting
2. As a user, I want to have the option to load my saved game instead of creating a new game

This project was a great opportunity to apply the knowledge I learned in class to develop something that I am interested
in and have a passion to work on. In particular, the challenge of creating a multiplayer application enticed me, as I 
did not have experience in this field.
