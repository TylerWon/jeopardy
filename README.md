## Inspiration
I created this project for the software construction course (CPSC 210) that I took in 2020 Winter - Term 1. The project
consisted of four phases which had to be completed throughout the term. Each phase was structured around a *user story*,
which was essentially a feature that a user would want in the program. For instance, phase two of the project involved
adding data persistence to the appplication, so some of the user stories I thought of were: 

1. As a user, I want to have the option to save my game before quitting
2. As a user, I want to have the option to load my saved game instead of creating a new game

I decided to recreate the popular trivia game Jeopardy because I have fond memories of watching it on T.V. with my family 
as a child.I rarely ever succeeded in answering any of the questions correctly, however, I still enjoyed the 
competitiveness and overall atmosphere the show brought to my family whenever we were watching it. As such, one of my 
main motives for creating this project was to restore some of this nostalgia from my younger years. The interactiveness 
of the application compared to just watching the show on television would reignite some of those old feelings, while also 
generating a more competitive environment. In addition, this project was a great opportunity to apply the knowledge I 
learned in class to develop something that I am interested in and have a passion to work on. In particular, the 
challenge of creating a multiplayer application enticed me, as I did not have experience in this field.
